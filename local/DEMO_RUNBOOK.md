## 7. Tips & Tricks

### Natural Language Works
You don't need to use technical commands. Claude understands natural language:
- "Show me..." instead of "search_quotes"
- "Mark this as favorite" instead of "toggle_favorite"
- "Explain this quote" instead of "get_quote_explanation"

### Quote IDs
Pay attention to quote IDs (shown as `[#]` in search results). You'll need them for:
- Marking favorites
- Adding notes
- Getting explanations
- Deleting quotes

### Combine Operations
You can chain operations in one prompt:
```
Find quotes about mindset, then explain the first one in terms of learning TypeScript.
```

### Export Your Favorites
```
Show me all my favorite quotes formatted as a markdown list that I can copy into my journal.
```

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Server Not Showing in Claude Desktop
- Check that Claude Desktop was restarted
- Verify the config file path is correct
- Ensure `dist/` folder exists (run `npm run build`)

### AI Features Not Working
- Verify `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check that the API key is valid at platform.deepseek.com
- Restart Claude Desktop after setting environment variables

### Quotes Not Persisting
- Check that `quotes.json` exists in the `local/` folder
- Verify file permissions allow read/write
- Look for error messages in Claude Desktop's MCP logs
