## 1. Enablement

### Claude Desktop Setup

1. **Add to Configuration**

   Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stoic-mcp": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "C:\\github\\stoic-mcp\\local\\dist\\index.js"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important:** Update the path to match your installation location.

2. **Set Environment Variable** (if not already set)

   ```bash
   # Windows (System Properties > Environment Variables)
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

   The environment variable is automatically inherited by Claude Desktop.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

   Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

4. **Verify Connection**

   Look for the MCP icon (üîå) in Claude Desktop indicating connected servers.

### VS Code Setup (Optional)

If you want to use this with VS Code's MCP support:

1. Install the MCP extension for VS Code
2. Add similar configuration to VS Code settings
3. Restart VS Code

## 7. Tips & Tricks

### Natural Language Works
You don't need to use technical commands. Claude understands natural language:
- "Show me..." instead of "search_quotes"
- "Mark this as favorite" instead of "toggle_favorite"
- "Explain this quote" instead of "get_quote_explanation"

### Quote IDs
Pay attention to quote IDs (shown as `[#]` in search results). You'll need them for:
- Marking favorites
- Adding notes
- Getting explanations
- Deleting quotes

### Combine Operations
You can chain operations in one prompt:
```
Find quotes about mindset, then explain the first one in terms of learning TypeScript.
```

### Export Your Favorites
```
Show me all my favorite quotes formatted as a markdown list that I can copy into my journal.
```

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Server Not Showing in Claude Desktop
- Check that Claude Desktop was restarted
- Verify the config file path is correct
- Ensure `dist/` folder exists (run `npm run build`)

### AI Features Not Working
- Verify `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check that the API key is valid at platform.deepseek.com
- Restart Claude Desktop after setting environment variables

### Quotes Not Persisting
- Check that `quotes.json` exists in the `local/` folder
- Verify file permissions allow read/write
- Look for error messages in Claude Desktop's MCP logs

## 9. Sample Session Output

Here's what a typical session might look like:

‚Äî Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

You: Explain that in terms of handling production incidents.

Notes updated for:
"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."
